### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a data scientist with a foundation in healthcare, machine learning, and research. I specialize in turning complex datasets—clinical, behavioral, or societal—into actionable insights and predictive models. With experience across deep learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization, I enjoy working on projects that are both ethically responsible and technically innovative.

Passionate about LLMs, responsible AI, explainability (XAI), and real-world ML deployment.  
Actively seeking Fall 2025 internships in Data Science, Applied ML, or AI Research.
